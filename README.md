## Abstract:
#Objective:
The application uses image segmentation from inputted images for the purpose of creating collages. Hopefully getting aesthetically pleasing or at least interesting results. We'll use  a bigger image for definition of a background while smaller ones will be extracted of interesting features to be pasted on to the canvas.

#Datasets:
The images will be obtained from two different datasets (included in folders on the repository):
* Corel1000 - chosen for the smaller images;
* Flickr15K - chosen for the background images
Both datasets were suggested by professor Moacir Ponti.

#Steps:
The prefered approach to the project will be:
* Apply the OpenCV function, saliency(), on the smaller images in order to obtain a gray-scale image of the objects of interest;
* Apply another OpenCV function, threshold(), again on the smaller images to obtain a binary image which makes it easier to cut out the objects acquired in the first step;
* Next we find the contour of the objects in the image and actually cut it;
* The background will be randomly selected from the Flickr15K dataset;
* Paste the cut features on the background avoiding excessive overlap.
